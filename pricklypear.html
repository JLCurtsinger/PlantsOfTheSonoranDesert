                <h2>Plant Uses</h2>
                <p>
                    Prickly pear cacti are easy to identify by their segmented, oval shaped pads that form branches and also by the red fruits that can be found on the tops of their pads when in season.
                    The pads of prickly pear cacti can be cooked and eaten for a nutritious meal. The fruits are edible and nutritious as well. Medicinally, prickly pear can be used to treat liver issues, ulcers, and more.
