                <p>Organ Pipe cacti can be found in Organ Pipe National Monument in Southern Arizona on the Mexican border growing on rocky, south-facing slopes. This is the only area in the United States where Organ Pipes grow naturally, although they can grow in other parts of the state if planted and are seen in landscaping throughout the lower elevations of Arizona. Outside of Arizona, they can be found in Sonora, Sinaloa, and Baja Califrnia Mexico. Their range is limited by freezing temperatures and frost to which they are not tolerant.

                <p>
                    Historically, the Organ Pipe cactus has been an essential tool to the Tohono O'odham people. They use the Organ Pipe cactus for construction material, as well as a nutrient dense fruit that could also be turned into wine, preserves, and more. The plants were so important to the Tohono O'odham people that it's fruiting season is the basis for which their calendar revolves around.
