  description:
    "Creosote bush is one of the most common and resilient shrubs in the Sonoran Desert. It's known for its distinctive 'desert rain' smell after storms and for surviving extreme heat and drought. This evergreen shrub features small, waxy leaves; yellow five-petaled flowers; and fuzzy white seed heads later in the season, often forming wide, rounded mounds. It thrives in desert flats, bajadas, and open scrub across the Sonoran Desert, preferring full sun and well-drained soils. Often blooms after rainfall, commonly in spring and sometimes again after summer monsoons. Creosote has a long history of traditional use, especially as an herbal preparation. It can be irritating or unsafe if misused, so this site treats it as an educational reference rather than a guide for ingestion. A keystone desert plant that provides cover and micro-habitat for insects and small wildlife.",
