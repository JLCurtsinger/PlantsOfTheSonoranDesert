    "Desert marigold is a bright, yellow wildflower commonly seen across the Sonoran Desert, especially after winter and spring rains. Its daisy-like flowers and silvery-green leaves make it one of the most recognizable seasonal blooms. This low-growing perennial features soft, gray-green leaves and bright yellow flowers with layered petals, often forming small clumps along open ground. It thrives in open desert flats, roadsides, disturbed soil, and rocky slopes throughout the Sonoran Desert. Typically blooms from late winter through spring, with timing dependent on rainfall. Desert marigold is an important nectar source for pollinators and is commonly used in native desert landscaping due to its hardiness and long bloom period.",
