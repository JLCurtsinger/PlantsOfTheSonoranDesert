  description:
    "Barrel cacti are ribbed, globe-to-column shaped cacti common in the Sonoran Desert. They store water in thick tissue, grow prominent spines, and often develop a ring of flowers and fruit near the crown in season. Identification tips: look for their rounded to barrel shape, strong vertical ribs, and heavy spines. Older plants may lean toward the sun, and flowers and fruit often appear near the top. Barrel cacti are found on rocky slopes, bajadas, desert flats, and wash edges, thriving in full sun to partial shade depending on the site. Historically used in limited ways by Indigenous peoples for food and water in survival contexts, but harvesting is not recommended and many plants are protected. Best appreciated as a keystone desert plant and wildlife resource. Do not touch spines; avoid disturbing plants; stay on trails.",
