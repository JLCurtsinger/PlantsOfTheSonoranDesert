  description:
    "Palo verdes are distinctive desert trees and shrubs known for their green, photosynthetic bark—a remarkable adaptation that allows them to continue producing energy even when their small leaves drop during drought. These drought-deciduous plants are well-adapted to arid conditions, with multiple palo verde species occurring throughout the Sonoran Desert. They produce clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers in spring, followed by bean-like seed pods. The appearance of palo verdes can vary by species and environmental conditions, with some growing as small trees and others as larger shrubs. Their green bark is one of their most distinctive features, making them easily recognizable even when leafless. Palo verdes play an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for wildlife, and their flowers are an important nectar source for pollinators during spring blooms.",
