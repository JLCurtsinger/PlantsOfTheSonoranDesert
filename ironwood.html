                <p>The Ironwood tree (Olneya Tesota) is native/endemic to the Sonoran Desert of the United States and Mexico. The natural habitat range of this Ironwood species is closely related to the boundaries of the Sonoran Desert. They are the largest of the Sonoran Desert trees and can grow up to 45 feet tall and 50 feet wide. Ironwoods bloom for about two weeks each year in the springtime; usually in May.</p>

                    The Desert Ironwood can be identified by a slender lower section that ascends into a broad crown, giving them an overall shape similar to an upside-down triangle (similar to the shape of a Desert Willow or Palo Verde). They can be single or multi-trunked. Young Ironwoods have smooth gray, sometimes shiny bark that is broken open as the tree ages and forms wrinkles. They are nearly an evergreen, keeping their leaves for most of the year unless they experience extreme cold or drought. Their leaves are small oval shapes running opposite of each other in pairs up the length of the leaf from its base. There is a pair of thorns at the base of each leaf.
