                <p>There are more than 30 species of Cholla cactus (pronounced choy-uh) but this page refers to the Cholla genus in general unless a specific species is mentioned. <br>
                Chollas are segmented, tree-like cacti that are native to areas in Northern Mexico and the Southwestern United States among other areas. <br>
                They can be identified in general by their segmented or jointed sections that are almost entirely covered in spines. The spines are typically a lighter whitish, or yellowish color and are sheated to help protect them from intense sunlight. </p>

                <h2>Plant Uses</h2>
                <p>
                    Cholla cactus roots can be used to treat the flu, stomach pain, urinary tract infections, and general inflammation. The dried stem pith can be applied to earaches for relief. 
                    <br>
                    The sheaths that cover the thorns can be pounded to make a paste that is useful for treating boils. Two tablespoons worth of Cholla bud contains more calcium than a glass of milk. 
                    <br>
                    They also contain salt and can help prevent dehydration in its early stages by replenishing lost salts. Ashes of burnt Cholla can be applied to cuts and burns to help them heal.
